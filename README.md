## Introduction

Lumen Horizon is based on the official [Laravel Horizon](https://github.com/laravel/horizon) package.

It provides the same features as original package except the dashboard UI because of the Lumen nature.
However all stats are available with Horizon [API routes](https://github.com/servocoder/lumen-horizon/blob/master/routes/web.php).
You are free to fetch and leverage the data on your own.

Alternatively, you can install another Laravel application with Horizon on the board to watch jobs and metrics of your Lumen applications.
Yep, the Laravel Horizon dashboard will show supervisor's processes that you run with Lumen. Enjoy!

## Official Documentation

Documentation for Horizon can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs/master/horizon).
